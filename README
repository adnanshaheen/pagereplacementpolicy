Compilation:
------------
There are two commands available to compile the code.
1- Debug mode
   Use the "make.debug" script to compile the code using debug mode.
   Command "# ./make.debug"
2- Release mode
   Use the "make.rel" script to compile the code using release mode.
   Command "# ./make.rel"

User can use the commands listed in the script files to compile with more options as well,
such as
    --enable-warnings
    Enable the warnings during compilation process, see the "configure.ac" for list of warning flags

The compilation script will look for required header files to confirm code compilation
Required files to run the compilation script properly
    NEWS, ChangeLog, AUTHORS, README, Makefile.am, src/*, include/*

project options
    Once the code is compiled and a binary "src/prp" is created
    we can provide the following input parameters to binary

    Usage: prp [options]

    Page replacement policy
    prp -f <filename>

    -f, --filename FILENAME Use file for input processes
   
For debugging mode only, additional flag
    -d, --debug             Show debugging information

    e.g. commands:
    ./prp -f input.txt
    ./prp -f input1.txt
    ./prp -f input2.txt

NOTE: The program works on an input file, the file may contain spaces between input data. The program will ignore it.
One file should contain only one page replacement policy algorithm type, and its frame size and pages.
